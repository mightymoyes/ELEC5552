# ELEC5552 Electrical and Electronic Engineering Design Project 2 -- BLDC Motor Tester with Controllable Load

## Description
The BLDC Motor Tester with Controllable Load is an open-source project designed to provide testing for a BLDC motor using a controllable load BLDC. 
The controller is developed to alter the load of the BLDC motor which is coupled to the BLDC motor under test. The torque, speed, power, voltage, current and temperature of the BLDC motor under test are logged to a PC for visualisation of results.
